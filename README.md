# Predicting Infant Health at Birth With Machine Learning
Patrick Arnold

This project was completed as part of the Data Science curriculum at the Flatiron School. 


## Objective
The PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System) network is a division of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. They have collected data on over 80% of the births that occur in the United States in order to better understand the risks to mothers and infants during pregnancy and childbirth. PRAMS has asked me to analyze US natality data in order to predict whether infants will need emergency medical intervention at birth.

## Project Description
A widely used metric for infant health shortly after childbirth is the APGAR score. It factors in the infant's appearance, pulse, reflexes, activity, and respiration to generate a score between 1 and 10. Scores 7 and above are considered healthy and these infants typically have positive health outlooks. Scores 6 and below can represent life-threatening situations and emergency medical intervention may be needed. I plan to build a machine learning classifier that can predict whether or not an infant's APGAR score will be in the healthy or unhealthy range.
